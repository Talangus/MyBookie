# Esports Betting Site Web Scraper

## Overview

This project aimed to develop a web scraper for esports betting sites to collect real-time match data and winning odds. However, due to personal commitments and external circumstances, including increased responsibilities at home and ongoing events in Israel, the project couldn't be completed as originally intended.

## Status
As of  03/2024, the project remains unfinished.
While the initial groundwork has been laid, including setting up the project environment, conducting preliminary research, bulding some web scarpers and analyze the sampled data , it is far from being finished.

## Future Plans
Although progress has been halted for the time being, I remain committed to exploring the possibility of revisiting and completing this project in the future. However, the timeline for resuming work on this project is currently uncertain and will depend on various factors, including changes in personal and external circumstances.
